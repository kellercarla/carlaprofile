					<h2>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCES</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="list-bottom">
							<p><strong> Made In France exhibition </strong> 
  
								<br>I had the opportunity to promote a French brand at the Made In France trade show in Paris. I advised customers on their choices and accompanied them through to the conclusion of the sale.</br>
								
							<p/>	
						</li>

						<li class="list-bottom">
							<p><strong> Hostess, Circuit Paul Ricard </strong> 
  
								<br>Living close to the Paul Ricard motor racing circuit in Le Castellet, I was able to participate in a number of automobile events as a hostess. I was therefore in contact with a luxury clientele. This first approach corresponds to my desire to work with high-level customers in the future.</br>

						<li class="list-bottom">
							<p><strong> Seasonal job, Gastronomic caterer </strong> 
  
								<br>Last summer, I worked for a caterer specializing in luxury events. This experience enabled me to work under pressure, as orders had to be prepared quickly for private events of over 500 people. I had to be organized, efficient and, above all, rigorous.</br>

					<h2>Travel</h2>
					<p> Like many people, I love traveling. Thanks to my parents, I have had the opportunity to discover many countries with very different cultures. Having lived the life of an expatriate, I would also like to live it myself, so that I can offer the same experience to my children. I lived in Slovakia for 6 years before moving to France. I was supposed to go to Buenos Aires in Argentina the following year, but due to a setback, my parents canceled the move. Now I'm planning to go there, especially as an exchange student.

				<div class="card-white">
					<h2>Luxury</h2>
					<p> I have always been attracted to the world of luxury, particularly luxury architecture. I'm impressed by the possibility of creating outstanding properties in magnificent locations. I am also intrigued by the finesse required in this world, whether in interior design or even fashion. My aim is to combine my two passions - travel and luxury architecture - in my work.
